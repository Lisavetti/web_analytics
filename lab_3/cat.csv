MoscuPekin,How similar is your cat's schedule to yours? Is there a way to change it?,0,2024-05-27 19:49:19+00:00,"What time does your cat wake up to eat? Does it coincide with the time you should be getting up to start your day?  
Is there a way to change the feeding schedule of a cat whose biological clock is as precise as a Swiss watch?



**Let me tell you my story:** My cat wakes up religiously every morning, an hour and a half before the time I should be getting up. She comes to my room and starts with some subtle but insistent meows. If that doesn't work, she looks for the prettiest piece of furniture she can find to conveniently sharpen her claws. If that still doesn't wake me up, she showcases her acting talents by performing her famous play ""***Help, neighbors, my human hasn't fed me for a month!***""

I get up and head to the kitchen while listening to her victorious purring. I see her sitting next to her food bowl, completely full of dry food, and she looks at me with those eyes that say, ""You don't expect me to eat this, do you?"".                                                                                                                              So, I proceed to mix her dry food with a bit of wet food and give it to her. I watch her take only three bites (leaving the rest) and walk triumphantly out of the kitchen, not without giving me a look that says, *""Go back to bed, human, what are you doing up at this hour?*""



Is there a way to change her schedule? Do automatic feeders work for wet food? (She always has dry food available... but let's say she has a refined palate...)",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d20dvg/how_similar_is_your_cats_schedule_to_yours_is/

BellJar_Blues,Doesn‚Äôt seem to recognize other cats,0,2024-05-27 19:24:49+00:00,"As the title says.  My cat doesn‚Äôt seem to notice other cats. I will point them out to him out the window or when we are on walks while he‚Äôs in the stroller.  He looks everywhere but where the cat is.  Is this just a protection thing ? 
The other day ago a cat came right up to us and rubbed against his stroller and myself.  I was pointing to the cat and the cat to look into the stroller to see my cat.  Then suddenly the cat saw it was another cat (can they not smell them there ?! ) and then started to back up and hiss and cough like it was anxious. Then just stared at my cat who literally was looking at the clouds the entire time and was seemingly oblivious to the cat hissing and what not.  

What happened here ? 

I‚Äôm contemplating getting a kitten to keep my cat company but I don‚Äôt know if this is a good or bad sign ? 
Good on the sense that my cat didn‚Äôt show any distress or crying or aggression but I just don‚Äôt understand.

Minimum-Cry615,Kitten peeing on laundry/blankets. Help? ,0,2024-05-27 19:22:20+00:00,"We have two new kittens, about 13-14 weeks old. They were neutered before we brought them home.  One of them peed on my daughter's bed a few days after arrival, so we took him to the vet for a possible UTI. They found a really minor amount of bacteria but we did a course of antibiotics. It's been a couple of weeks and he's still periodically peeing on a blanket or laundry. Not sure what to do, we're keeping clothes and blankets up and out of reach as much as possible but it's nearly impossible to remove everything (we do have beds, and laundry baskets!). Additional info:

--We have two litter boxes in their ""safe room"" where they have their toys, food, cat tree, etc. They sleep in this room over night with my daughter, and are confined to this room when we aren't home. It's a huge room, they have plenty of space. We are super on it with the litter scooping and it stays very clean. 

--We are using World's Best cat litter. Kitten is fine pooping in the box, and pees in it sometimes but obviously not always. He doesn't seem to have an issue with the litter, he happily scratches, spends plenty of time cleaning up when he does use it. 

--He will sometimes look a little lost, meow a little, and search for something to pee on, then look like he's about to pee (scratching). If we catch him and put him in the litter box at this moment, he will pee in the box. 

--I have three additional litter boxes in the house aside from the two in their bedroom. One upstairs and two downstairs. They have used the upstairs one once, but not the downstairs ones. Unfortunately I've found two pees downstairs on laundry and a beanbag chair, (and that's just what I've found). I've shown them the extra boxes several times and they just jump right out. 

--The kittens are the only cats using the litter boxes. We have two older cats who only go outside to potty. The kittens really like the older cats and the older cats are warming up to them. In other words they aren't afraid of them. 

--They otherwise seem happy and healthy and curious as kittens should be. It's just the peeing that's a problem.

beaisbaby,Cat personality change? ,0,2024-05-27 19:06:17+00:00,"Does anyone feel like their cat is completely different than who they met at the shelter? When I was looking to adopt a cat, I was visiting my local shelter multiple days for week to spend time with the cats and see who I felt would ‚Äúchoose‚Äù me. 

There was 2 days in a row I specifically spent time with the cat I have today because I wanted to make sure it‚Äôd be a good fit and I really love her. At the time she was 11 months old. At first she was shy but extremely friendly when I introduced myself and was very playful. I even brought my boyfriend the next day to see how they interacted with each other and she was very open and welcoming to him as well. I specifically wanted a friendly cat because I live at home with my family and I wanted them to love her as well. 

That was not exactly what happened though. After adopting her she stayed secluded with me because she had come home to me after being spayed so I kept her activity to a minimum. After about a week or so, I tried introducing her to my family and she was not as welcoming as she was with me. She would hiss and claw at them if they tried to get close, and still does that to this day. 

Maybe I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to get her to open up? She acts like this with anyone that isn‚Äôt me or my boyfriend now. Towards the rest of my family and any guests that walk through the door.

I can't believe how much it hurts.

He's been the most loyal and reliable cat for 11.5 years, I found him on the side of the road when he was a couple of weeks old and ever since then, he's been the center of our lives - he's been there through every up and down life threw at us.

I'm so unbelievably heartbroken that I didn't see any warning signs; I always thought he'd live to at least 14, and that I'd see his declining health and vitality, and he somewhat prepared for his death but I didn't see any signs apart from slight weight loss and he wasn't keen on eating his own kibble, but stole ae much food from our plates as he could get away with, so to my mind, he still had an appetite, just not for his own dry food, which is fair enough. 

I'm just here to share and if anyone has any advice, or similar experiences, I'd love to hear. I'm feeling so awful that he might have not been well, and I didn't notice. :-(",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1z7bn/my_heart_is_broken_tw/

KushPiglet,Recommendations for automatic feeders?,3,2024-05-27 17:37:39+00:00,"I bought a smart feeder from Vivitar a few years back and have never had an issue with it up until this year. A few weeks ago, someone had hacked our account and was calling to our cat and letting food out randomly or in excessive amounts. We were terrified, to say the least. We changed all passwords and reset everything. Then again a few days ago, assuming it was the same person, we realized we were either hacked again or they were never kicked off after removing all accounts/password change. I did reach out to Vivitar and it was unbelievable how unhelpful they were. Ended up even calling the HQ and leaving messages for calls back. I did receive an email but was basically told they don‚Äôt know what to do but I can feel free to send it back if it was within 30 days that I bought it. So now, all I‚Äôm looking for is an automatic feeder that is reliable and isn‚Äôt so vulnerable to attacks (and maybe one that has a company that will actually help you and look into things)! What feeders do you use? 

To add, I have no problem hand feeding whatsoever, but with my cat‚Äôs dietary restrictions the feeder has been such a help with making sure she gets exactly what she needs and helps majorly if we are away a day or two.

I know that this sub can be a bit more US-centric where it isn‚Äôt considered the done thing to have an outdoor cat, but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any advice as to whether or not an indoor cat is best?

I have no other pets and plan on getting a rescue, maybe 2-4 years old so they‚Äôre a bit more chill than a kitten. Any specific advice as to getting them settled/bonding in first few days would also be much appreciated.

The shelter claims she's 3 years old. Observations about her are that she looks a little like a maine coon, not a full breed but some ancestry. Her paws are huge for her body. Her whiskers are also longer than her body. She behaves very kitten like. She's just incredibly baby.

When we got her she was 7.8 lbs. She's gained a little weight since then and I was looking at her last night and I feel like she's gotten taller? I have to wonder if whatever way she was living before stunted her? Also I don't think this cat is 3 years old. Our neighbor came over to see her and was like that's not a 3 year old cat. And saturday I was at a friend's and they had a tiny female cat whose paws match her body size. Tiny paws for a tiny cat. But our cat is a small girl with big paws. Its a small puzzle esp when we try to decide a cat anniversary.

However, despite all my research I'm having a lot of trouble trying to find ways cats show their age. After reaching adulthood they seem to look the exact same until they're extremely elderly. Then it looks like they get thinner and their fur sticks out more due to less self grooming. Given I want this character to be a plump baker these options don't really work.

Modgrinder666,"My new cat shat my kid's bed 3 times now, anything I could try ?",3,2024-05-27 16:38:36+00:00,"So last night I cleaned my kid's bed for the 3rd time because my cat, that I have since september, shat his bad again.

It happened 2 times about 3 months ago. First I wasn't sure if it was my first cat or the new cat, on the second I was more sure it was my new cat. So we kept the door closed until she spent most of her time outdoor. We keep his door closed, but we do open it now for fresh air in the summer.

Last night she did it again while he was sleeping, which is a new personnal best, last 2 times he wasn't there. But she is stucked indoors because she went under surgeries recently to have bad teeth removed (7 of them to be precise :\\) so it might be the indoor/outdoor influence.

Her rapport with my kid is... meh. They don't hate each other but they don't love each other either. And my kid isn't too noisy/dangerous to her compared to when he was younger with my first cat.

I am starting to think that maybe very old and faint piss and shit odors on the bed of my kid might be something to consider. Sure we have cleaned everything perfectly, but considering the number of times he made his diapers overflow with piss years ago, there could be something left that is easy for them to smell.

Anyone has any tips for an eventual 4rth shat ? My plan until she is free to go outside is, sadly, to lock her with litter food and water for the night. I do not really like cleaning shit for 20 minutes at 3 am.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1vs6q/my_new_cat_shat_my_kids_bed_3_times_now_anything/

Alternative_Carob380,Need advice on how far I should go to treat my 15 year old cat,1,2024-05-27 14:58:45+00:00,"I have a 15 year old tabby cat that is my whole world, honestly I‚Äôve had so many pets but never bonded to one the way I have with him.

About a week ago he had a sudden onset of pancreatitis that caused gallbladder inflammation and blockage as well as slight hepatitis. He spent 1 week in hospital (half at an ER and half at a specialist) received IV fluids and other medications.  He is jaundice (poor guy looks like a banana), icteric and his eyes look so weak. He has lost almost all his body weight, I can feel his bones when I hold him. The vets were optimistic that he would get better with the supportive care but he didn‚Äôt. 

They said his last option is a surgery to place a stent in the gallbladder, which would later have to be removed (so 2 surgeries). They said it‚Äôs a rare surgery and in healthy cats survival rate is 50%.

He is taking all his oral medications (antibiotic Clavamox, buprenorphine for pain, Denamarin for the liver, Ursodiol for bile flow, Cerenia for nausea / abdominal pain)

Yesterday his eating slowed down a lot. He had only a handful of temptations treats and a few licks of wet food. Today, he won‚Äôt eat anything at all. He‚Äôs still drinking plenty of water.

Should I take him back to the vet for a potential feeding tube? I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs too weak to handle surgery, definitely he can‚Äôt handle the gallbladder stent which is secondary to pancreatitis so it wouldn‚Äôt cure him anyway.

I don‚Äôt want him starving to death because he feels too sick to eat. I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do. I don‚Äôt want to torture my poor old boy. But I want to give him the best chance at recovery too. He‚Äôs extremely lethargic. He only walks a few steps before laying down. He‚Äôs still able to use the litter box normally.

My room isn‚Äôt the biggest but there‚Äôs enough space to fit her stuff and that‚Äôs where I was thinking of keeping her when I go to work.

ticman,Should we euthanize our little girl with FIV?,7,2024-05-27 14:19:02+00:00,"Hi all,

We have a gorgeous little ginger who is just over 7 years old now. About 6 months ago she tested positive for FIV after a blood infection put her into the vet care. The vet sorted her out with antibiotics and after a few days we took her home.

All was well for a few weeks but progressively it seems her condition is worsening. When she would miss her kitty litter or vomit once a week, it's now multiple times a day. Every morning we'll wake up to wee, poo and sometimes vomit.

She has no bowel control any more either, she can be laying on the couch or on your lap, suddenly yowl and then squirt everywhere.  It's bad enough that we're washing clothing, bed linen and blankets every day and sometimes more.

She is constantly hungry yet can see the sides of her ribs and seems very skinny. She will still bound around the house and occasionally have a spin outside for a few minutes before she's back inside on to the couch.

My wife and I are battling with deciding if it's time to put her down. Neither of us want to do it for selfish reasons, ie; the mess and constant cleaning, but we also can't tell how much pain she is in and if she has a good QoL. 

Personally I think she's not enjoying her time at the moment as she travels between the couch and kitty litter and emptying her stomach and bowels everywhere in between.

The vet has simply said it's up to us although they are concerned about the incontinence and weight, but being FIV+ it's also hard to know if that's just the way she is now and could live for many more years.

Has anyone had experience or can offer advice to us?

TIA!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1sla8/should_we_euthanize_our_little_girl_with_fiv/

slightly-mad-hatter,Need help - reintroducing cats ,4,2024-05-27 12:29:23+00:00,"Hi!

I adopted a cat 2 months ago from a family - they had 2 cat siblings that they said were fighting and they needed to separate them. 

I trusted them and took in the cat. It was in a bit of a rough shape, and not because of any fighting - the beautiful British longhair had hair matts all over that had to be cut out. One of his claws was recently cut too deep. He wasn't taught anything - brushing teeth, cleaning his eyes. He was a stress ball. After just two months, he's a constantly purring fluffy cloud. 

Now the family is giving away the other cat. This time, the reason is ""too much cleaning"". My heart is already breaking for that animal and I want to adopt it too. I'm also seriously doubting the initial reason, if in just two months the other cat is suddenly impossible to continue living with. 

How would you go about reintroducing them to each other? Technically, they've been together since births: over 3 years, and they were only separated for 2 months. Should I isolate them at all, or should I observe and adjust to their behaviour?

Any input will be appreciated!

A New Cat Color Is Defying Genetic Expectations
From roots to tips, this fur tells a tale of evolutionary wonder.
A new type of cat coat color has officially been discovered.
Named salmiak, or ‚Äòsalty liquorice,‚Äô the cats have hair strands that start out black, and become white the further they grown from the follicle. 
It turns out the unique color is caused by a recessive genetic mutation, rather than the expression of a gene known to turn cats white. 
You‚Äôve probably heard of spooky black cats, chaotic orange cats, and distinguished-looking tuxedo cats. If you‚Äôre really into cats, you might have even lesser-known color variants like seal point and ticked tabby. But there‚Äôs officially a new cat color in town‚Äî salmiak, or ‚Äòsalty liquorice.‚Äô

A Million-Year-Old Skull Could Prove the Dragon Man‚Äôs Direct Line to Humans
The pretty black, white, and grey shade‚Äînamed for a popular snack food in Finland, where this coat color has been making itself known‚Äîis thanks to a fur strand that starts off black near the root, but grows whiter and whiter out towards the tip. The coat was first spotted in 2007, and in 2019, it was brought to the attention of a group of cat experts lead by feline geneticist Heidi Anderson. Since then, the group has been trying to figure out exactly what causes this shade to express itself, and recently, they finally figured it out. A paper on the discovery has been published in the journal Animal Genetics.
When you‚Äôre digging into cat colors‚Äîor expressions of genetic traits in general, honestly‚Äîyou start with the obvious and work your way out. So, the researchers naturally started by assuming that this new variant was just a fun way for the white-making ‚Äòdilution‚Äô gene to make itself known. 

See, technically speaking, cats only come in two colors‚Äîblack and orange. Any other color is either a combination of those two colors, a faded version of one of those colors (which is caused by the dilution gene) or both. So, when experts started seeing salt-and-pepper kitties running around, the natural assumption was that these were an interesting new expression of the dilution gene coming into play. Add a little more white than usual to your standard black cat, and you get salty liquorice.
But after digging through all the known genetic variations that control the expression of that dilution gene in coat color, the team came up empty. So, they took the next step‚Äîsequencing the entire genome of two of these special felines and digging through the whole mess of genetic data to find what was causing these new coats to appear. 
It turns out that the answer was in what wasn‚Äôt there. ‚ÄúThere was a huge chunk of sequence missing downstream from the KIT gene,‚Äù Anderson told New Scientist, referencing a gene known to affect white patterns in the coats of animals. And these cats were just‚Ä¶ missing a piece of DNA right nearby. 
After testing 181 cats to make sure they knew what they were seeing, the team was able to confirm that the missing sequence was in fact responsible for the salmiak coat color. And the mutation was recessive‚Äîthe cat would only express this color if it inherited the mutation from both parents, which explains why this coloration isn‚Äôt a common one. 
Now that they‚Äôve solved the mystery, the team is happy to sit back and admire their pretty kitties along with the rest of the world. ‚ÄúThese coats have aroused a lot of admiration for years,‚Äù Anderson told New Scientist. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really exciting that we now have some genetic explanation for it.‚Äù
But they‚Äôre not just putting their feet up. According to a blog post written by Anderson, the solving of this puzzle both ‚Äúenriches our understanding of feline coat color genetics‚Äù and could be ‚Äúvaluable for breeding efforts, potentially contributing to the preservation of this trait in our feline companions.‚ÄùHopefully, we‚Äôll continue to see these fancy felines for years to come.

Ok_Remove9491,1 Yr old cat using litter only intermittently- we've tried everything incl multi vet visits,1,2024-05-27 10:58:28+00:00,"Hi,
Basically as it says above 1 year old cat will use the litter during the day, but at night she poops on the sitting room carpet, or the dining room beside the litter, and then pees right at our front door of the house.

Birdie was born in our house with her sister Happy, by their Mother Hilda who was a emergency Foster. Hilda had a hard birth, 1 kitten died, and the other two had to be stimulated to breath and then Hilda had no interest in them for the first 4 hours - it was a bad time especially since Hilda was a fiery feral cat.

Birdie and Happy developed well but I noticed that Birdie would imitate covering her poop when she finished her dinner, or she came along an empty food bowl. She also never covers her poops or peeps when she does use the litter. Happy uses the litter perfectly.
She would also periodically, as a young kitten, poop and peep outside of the litter.
Once Birdie and Happy were safely weeded we gradually introduced them to our 3 year old cat. They tolerate each other, there has been licks, and cuddles, and of course a few spats.
Birdie and Happy were diagnosed with Giardia which Happy didn't kick until 2 months od anti bs, and Birdie was a month. Birdie finally gave us 2 weeks of no pooping on the carpets but then relapsed.
Birdie also got a bad infection after her neutering so she was on anti bs again and we were back and forth to the vet like 10 times.
All this time I'm explaining the litter situation with the vet they even do blood tests, because I am convinced she's doing it because she is sore or sick. Nope.
We have tried all the litters you can think of, scented and unscented. When we clean the mess we show her us putting it in the litter and leave it in the litter for an hour or two. I have bleached and scrubbed the carpets each time she's done this - for a year!!!! Carpets are actually fine...considering- Thanks IKEA.
We have also tried putting gross smelling things like lemon oil and my husband made a spray that was discussed on another forum.
Also we have 3 litters for each cat in am area that they can have privacy. The litters are a mix of types - covered, high tray and low tray, medium to large sizes.

I am at my wits end!!
Also she is genuinely the sweetest cat, she demands love, and demands to be played with and wouldn't hurt a fly. I love her..I hate being so angry with her...How can I help this situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1owe6/1_yr_old_cat_using_litter_only_intermittently/

jukonii,Missing kitten ,2,2024-05-27 10:48:59+00:00,"Hello everybody,   
I wanted to ask some advice regarding my missing cat, so here's the story.  
My cat, Dio, is a house cat. On the 25th the fire alarm in my building went off (I live in a flat complex).  
In a hurry I took Dio with me downstairs to evacuate, however, and rightfully so, she was very frightened/stressed/anxious because of the loud alarm and once we got downstairs she jumped out of my arms and on the streets. I chased after her but she was nowhere to be found.  
  
I live in a very big/busy city and she never goes outside because I don't think it's safe enough for her to roam the streets freely (especially because of cars).  
now, it's been almost 2 days since she went missing, I've looked everywhere, more times than I can count, and probably in a way bigger radius than I needed to.  
  
I've hung up missing posters, sent a message in my neighborhood groupchat, posted her on the biggest site for missing pets in my country, made a paid ad on instagram/facebook, updated her chip as missing, contacted the nearby animal shelter, and put her bowl with some dry cat food outside the door.  
No matter where I look, or at what time, I haven't even caught a glimpse of her, which is making me feel very frustrated and hopeless.  
  
If there's anything anyone could add/give me insights on I would greatly appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1ore3/missing_kitten/

Recently he's been a bit aggressive towards me. He'll bite my wrist and arm (not till I bleed, but enough to hurt a bit) and use one of his paws to push my arm down. At first I thought he was trying to play, so I started spraying him with water to train him.

Today I noticed he does this weird thing where he speads his back legs a bit and starts moving closer to my arm.

Not sure if there are any vets or cat experts that can tell me if I'm going crazy or not, but someone please help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1mrrd/hey_so_is_my_cat_trying_to_mate/

argidev,My cat almost died on an airplane trip,0,2024-05-27 07:16:24+00:00,"So I figured I'd share the story of my airplane trip with my cat, in hopes it can help other cat owners with their decision to take their furry companion on board.

A few months ago I decided to move to Barcelona, and wanted to take my 4 year old cat along. I got lucky with the airline, as it allowed me to take the cat with me inside the cabin, so I was able to see his behaviour and pet it on the way.

 It was a 3 hour long trip, and while that wasn't very comfortable for the cat, we ended up alright on the other side.

However, things didn't really work out for me over there, so I had to move back to my home country after a few months, and on this trip my cat's experience was completetly different.

During the last hour of the trip, my cat started acting weird, breathing harder, and most importantly, starting foaming around the mouth. It was uncontrolably drooling and meowing due to the obvious discomfort.

I was almost sure he wouldn't survive, and there there was literally nothing I could do for him, other than pet and talk to him. By some miracle he got through this alive, but to this day I still believe there was a good chance he could have passed away on that flight.

I was lucky enough to be allowed to take him with me in the cabin and see his reaction, but I imagine many owners are not allowed to do that, so that it's possible you might never find out if this happens to your cat as well.

I personally won't ever put any of my pets through an airplane flight again, and if I ever decide to move out again, I'll use a car transportation service, which even though might take longer and come up with a different set of discomfort, it can't compare to what my cat experiences on a plane.

TL;DR: Avoid taking your cat on an airplane, at all cost ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1lvoo/my_cat_almost_died_on_an_airplane_trip/

nicole_kidnap,How to make my cats friends with the neighbours? ,0,2024-05-27 06:34:39+00:00,"Hello all, I have recently moved with my two spawned cats M6 and F3 in a new place. We picked this place because it has an enclosed garden free for them to roam around...until we found out the soon to be new neighbour has 4 cats that already live in the garden in a shack. They are all spawned and mostly friendly except the only girl he says.   
I am not letting them out yet to give them time to adapt to the new house, and the cats are now coming to peek through the windows. The boy doesn't really care, but my  girl hates EVERYONE. How to make them friendly? for now I am letting them peak at each other through windows and she doesn't seem amused. The neighbour's cats show no signs of distress they just look very curious and one of them really wants to cuddle. 

Additional info:  
1.they are all spawned, both mine and my neighbours'.

2. My neighbour hasn't moved in yet because the house was rented and it needs some renovations. He is the landlord's nephew, he is super kind and easy going though.

3. I think he plans to bringing them inside when the move is complete, but I don't really know how much he will be around because he lives with his adoptive aunt and is needed there most of the time. He comes whenever he can to feed the cats and water plants.

4. My cats are used to roaming around freely because our former place was in a car free neighborhood and they met many cats already, everything went well except the occasional fight. I am always at home when I let them around and I always bring them in at around 6-7 pm. The boy is very placid but his behaviour changed a bit when we adopted her. She is very territorial and will hiss and growl at everyone. 

I feel like a good part of the socialization issue is on me since I work from home and I really want to make it work. We plan to semi fence a part of our flowerbed, and I want to put an outdoor litterbox there. Any other idea? I have a relaxing catnip spray too.

here's some photos of my cats :)

Things started out fine (he would come to snuggle by me on the couch) but the last couple days he's come back home from the outside at night really risky. I tried to play with multiple toys (on strings, like fishpoles) but he gets disinterested very quickly and then has started grabbing my legs with his front legs and going to bite hard. He tried to corner me a few times and walked up to me in a way I knew he was going to strike (like I'm prey?) The biting doesn't feel playful it feels aggressive.

Help? I thought re-directing would help but it seems I'm more interesting than any toy. I'm wearing pants and covering my ankles now and put myself in another room, but I have to live and function the next few days. I can imagine he's stressed with me being around and his owner gone. Another friend said to just ignore him, no eye contact, just do the feeding and let him be from now on.

She's also taken up meowing at me and at my male cat, typically when I ask her what's wrong and we had a pretty set in stone policy, I ask and she takes me to:

A. The food bowls because she's hungry

B. The water bowl because the male cat likes to throw toys in it

C. One of the sinks which means she wants a bath 

D. She'll walk to the door indicating she's not feeling well and needs the vet (yes I know how it sounds but that has always been the case, she goes to the door and, lo and behold, my vet tells me there's something wrong)

But for the past day and a half now she's been pretty much not doing any of these things, she meows a little at me, no going anywhere just follows me, and then I'll sit back down in which she starts rubbing her head against me, meowing occasionally, and then laying down or grooming the male cat if he's sitting near me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1kedx/hi_cat_fans_and_vets/

I wanted to get her some company, and I fell in love with this 6month old cat that was up for adoption. He has hearing and mild neurological issues, and a slight digestion issue that causes runny poops. Other than that, he's healthy and happy. 

He's been to the vet several times for the digestion issue, and all the tests point to a mild pancreatic issue, but it doesn't seem to affect him in any way, and isn't helped by any change in food or addition of medication or supplements. 

My cat is fairly timid but curious about new things once she settles down a little. She took just 2 days to get used to a new person in the house, though she stayed attached to me. The possible new cat is very outgoing and a little boisterous, but on the whole sweet and harmless, and very friendly with cats and people. 

I will of course be going as slow as possible to allow them to meet. I'm going to give them enough time to get used to each other before I allow them to actually see each other. I have a spare room to keep them separate, and I will be scent swapping and following all the usual steps. 

I would love any advice on managing a deaf kitty. I know it won't affect his quality of life much, but I'd like any tips from owners of deaf kitties that may not seem obvious at first. Also, any advice to help the cats get along would be great. I will look for Feliway or something similar, but I doubt it's available in my country.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1i79f/adopting_a_deaf_cat_any_advice_on_caring_for_him/

blueembroidery,New fixed boy kitty spraying ,1,2024-05-27 01:41:13+00:00,"We just adopted an amazing boy cat yesterday. He‚Äôs been through it ‚Äî survived a dog attack and got fixed up at the shelter and neutered just 10 days ago. We brought him home yesterday. His wounds have fully healed but he was on antibiotics until recently. He is 3 years old and we assume feral, but SO friendly and never wants to be left alone. 

The first thing I noticed in the morning is that his room smelled BAD (he‚Äôs being kept from our other kitty while we do the slow Jackson Galaxy introduction method). He also howled all night, but he‚Äôs calmer today. I did a room swap and put our other cat in his room to let him explore the rest of our place. He immediately sprayed her scratching post and our computer tower. 

We‚Äôre very experienced cat owners but this is a first and I‚Äôm terrified we‚Äôve just adopted a chronic sprayer. We rent so we can‚Äôt keep him if the behavior continues. What solutions do people have? Is 3 years too late, and will he spray forever, or will he calm down as he adjusts? He still needs to be introduced to our sweet older cat, who has lived with other cats before and is stressed but will adjust. 

We have Feliway in most rooms but not his room so we corrected that right away. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1gjqn/new_fixed_boy_kitty_spraying/

Mina and Mara lived at my moms with me for some of their life before moving to away three years ago. 

Two years ago we got Max. Mina took her under her wing and essentially became her mom or big sister. My cats do NOT have a history of hissing t each other or swatting out of anger.

Fast forward to yesterday, I moved back into my mom‚Äôs how and Mina and Mara are hissing at Max, swatting at her, hissing when they go into a room she‚Äôs in.

I know moving is stressful but I am wondering if it‚Äôs normal they are being mean to Max, maybe because Max didn‚Äôt grow up here like they did? They are roaming the house like they own the place, so I am assuming it‚Äôs territorial?  

It makes me sad because Mina and Max are best buds and Max is being bullied lol

The problem I have and need the solution for is the ""trap"", I have either a box, a big bag, trying to find a bigger box in the trash, or buying a cat carrier. Those are my 4 options but rn I have only the box and the big bag, the box I'm concerned if she will fit inside well enough for me to catch her, the big bag is bigger and would definitely fit her but I'm worried if she will feel uncomfortable in the bag's material, the bigger box I don't know if I will be able to find one in the trash and the cat carrier I don't know if I will be able to buy one in time.

EasterBunnyArt,Thank you stranger for your advice (I stayed till the end),10,2024-05-27 00:41:41+00:00,"Thank you stranger that had mentioned a while back, that when the time comes to make sure you are there with your pet. Today I had the soul breaking duty for that last moment. I knew it was coming from the day I had foster failed Izzie. She was the runt of her litter of 11 siblings with 2 mothers. I will never look back at that time and not claim it was not a struggle to raise all 11 and ensure the mothers were healthy as well. From the beginning all were in some form of bad shape. But we had managed to get them all healthy.

Izzie unfortunately had a weakened immune system and could never handle the feline herpes virus. She always had a snotty nose and struggled with breath. Steroids helped a bit but it came back. Lysine helped a bit but not enough. Between the vitamin and lysine I had hoped it was solved since she started to snot out massive feline boogers.

But I knew it all would take an inevitable toll on her. This morning I saw some red-ish drool on her mouth and took her to the vet. On a hunch she checked the lungs and there was fluid. Could be the lungs themselves or the hearth. I instantly knew what the original issue was, after all, I had dealt with it from the beginning.

I miss you Izzie 7 years were not long enough. I made sure she felt my hand and saw me till the end. But damn was it still painful despite knowing all this time it was coming.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1fhvj/thank_you_stranger_for_your_advice_i_stayed_till/

Not_enough_cats4341,I've come to the horrific conclusion I'm (more than likely) allergic to cats now,11,2024-05-27 00:25:22+00:00,"40M, living in the home (I pay the mortgage and bills, but let‚Äôs face it: I‚Äôm their underling) of a calico named Danny DeVito and a spicy tortie named Alma. No history whatsoever of allergies. For the last two months, I've noticed my eyes feel really dry and are prone to redness. Skin on my face is blotchy when it's normally even-toned, and, in particular, my wrists and ankles are constantly itchy. 

Both cats are brushed 2x/week (including a weekly dander-reducing spray), and I vacuum/sweep my entire home every 2-3 days. At first, I thought it may be seasonal allergies due to living in the Midwest, until realizing my symptoms get worse after handling my roommates; particularly, Mr. DeVito. I have an appointment set with dermatology, but it's not until late June. 

Any particular medications, or even better, strategies to minimize symptoms? I'm not big on taking meds but at this point I'll do pretty much anything. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1f7a8/ive_come_to_the_horrific_conclusion_im_more_than/

So quick run down we adopted sultan when he was 8 weeks old along with simba who was 6 years old, simba ran away day 3 and we ended up adopting truffles (1 years old) a month later. Couple weeks after adopting truffles simba was found and returned to us. Sultan and simba were always close and cuddly while truffles was a very anxious girl and only bonded with sultan but didn‚Äôt like being near simba. Year and half later all three of them are very open and not anxious anymore but simba and truffles never cuddle or clean each other. We ended up moving 3 months ago and all the cats adapted really quickly. So here is where the protectiveness comes in. This past month simba has been jumping on counters and going through the sink, digging through trash, and being very aggressive. One day simba attacked truffles and sultan ended up yowling at him for hours and getting into hardcore cat fights. Then the next day they are normal and cuddly, every now and then sultan and simba fight without truffles being the reason. Is it normal for cats to randomly becoming protective? I‚Äôve read online it‚Äôs when a new cat is introduced but simba has been here for over a year and half. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1eoz8/my_cat_is_protective_is_this_normal/

crowrots,My cat is more affectionate ,0,2024-05-26 23:18:18+00:00,"I have 2 cats, Spirit and Banshee. I adopted them about 3 years ago and have become accustomed to their different personalities. Banshee has always been more aloof, seeking attention and pets rarely when she feels like it. She'll sleep beside me, but thats the extent of her affection. Spirit is the exact opposite, loves everyone and all the attention she can get. 
About two weeks ago, Banshee got a cold and I nursed her back to health. Gave her medicine she hated, provided plenty of blankets in dark spots near her food & litter box. Gave her whatever she needed. Since then, she seems to be more affectionate. Sleeping next to me every night, laying on my desk when i'm working on it, playing more with Spirit, purring a lot more, exploring the house more than she used to. She seems to have really come out of her shell. 
Everywhere that I've looked says that this usually is a sign of illness in cats, but I don't see it. She's using the litter box, eating, and drinking all at a normal level. She was never food motivated and still isn't, but she does show up for meal times now opposed to before. 
Is there any other cause that isn't illness related that could make my cat more friendly? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1dxc9/my_cat_is_more_affectionate/

zirconst,"Vet situation, two seniors, would love some advice ",1,2024-05-26 23:15:18+00:00,"We have two lovely and dumb senior cats (both 14). After we had kids we kinda fell behind on vet appointments because they've both been in good health. A month ago we took them in for checkups where they got a clean bill of health except for teeth needing a cleaning. The vet also wanted to do routine bloodwork which they haven't had in years.

We had scheduled all that for this week when my vet said she is on indefinite leave due to breaking her arm. She could be back in a month or a year. 

If we start with a new vet, we'll need more appointments before we can even so a dental or bloodwork. Naturally the cats hate going to the vet, it stresses them out, and one is such a terror there we have to give him gabapentin beforehand. So I'm a little reluctant to start a new vet relationship, pay extra for redundant appointments, and subject the cats to unnecessary stress.... 

On the other hand, even though they appear to be in good health it's always possible they have an underlying problem that we need to catch.

What would you do in our position? Wait 1 to 12 months and put off tests and dental, or take them to a new place at the cost of extra appointments and stress? Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1dvbo/vet_situation_two_seniors_would_love_some_advice/

ScaredyCat30,Urinary advice ,0,2024-05-26 22:31:44+00:00,"My cat (Male, 7) has just had a bloody pee, just a small dot of blood on a quite large amount. In his usual cat litter. He didn‚Äôt seem to have any trouble with it and went on to demolish a bowl of wet food.

About 5 years ago he had a UTI which was very sudden with a complete blockage. He was in obvious pain, couldn‚Äôt wee (had no bloody urine until after the procedure), and has been on medicated biscuits ever since. Vet couldn‚Äôt say if it was bacterial or dietary, so it was just in case. 

Aside from this, and from a fight he had two months ago, he has always been healthy. 

Recently (last 4-6 months) he has been eating my other cats usual biscuits (Cats Republic) on top of his medicated biscuits and wet food, and I know I should have stopped him but it‚Äôs been so long and he was purring his head off every time he ate them. Might be relevant, might not be. 

Its a bank holiday tomorrow and the vets will not be open, otherwise I would have been calling at 8am. I strongly dislike our local emergency vets because they once recommended putting down our dog and it turns out she had a minor stroke that 90+% of dogs go on to be fine from, she is still fine 3 years later, so perhaps that is clouding my judgement but I really don‚Äôt want to take him there. 

Sorry for rambling, but my question is, in people‚Äôs experience of a drop of blood in urine, and no other symptoms, would it be okay to wait until Tuesday (unless of course nothing else happens) or would you take yours to the emergency vets asap tomorrow?

SadakoFetish1st,Should I adopt a street cat?,2,2024-05-26 22:30:15+00:00,"We have a orange cat in our Greek vacation neighborhood. She's been coming to as for the second year in a row and always begs for food. So she is used to us, laying down a lot and using walls to scratch her body. When I open the door, she quickly tries to enter (though she tries to get out just as quickly if she manages to break in).


However, she does not like being touched at all. We tried  repeatedly and she either bites or smacks us with her paws. Not only is she not fond of physical interaction, I'd also need to get her vaccinated, probably dewormed, chipped, and groomed. She'd also need a EU passport which admittedly is pretty cheap. 

Should I adopt her and take her to Germany? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1cyzq/should_i_adopt_a_street_cat/

2pam,For cats who suffered a bladder obstruction requiring emergent treatment‚Ä¶did your kitty end up with the same issue again eventually? ,1,2024-05-26 22:19:33+00:00,"My poor baby boy is currently hospitalized for a few days after a fully obstructed bladder. He will okay but it was a really awful night and he was so distressed before rushing him to the ER. 

The vet is recommending a perineal urethrostomy (PU) because his obstruction was really bad and he thinks he may re-obstruct as it‚Äôs quite common. 
This procedure seems so invasive, so I was wondering if other owners who have gone through this with their kitty actually only had 1 episode and never again? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1cr0h/for_cats_who_suffered_a_bladder_obstruction/

i_am_pichael,One of Our Cats is Peeing Next to the Litterbox,6,2024-05-26 21:01:51+00:00,"Between my sister and I, we have 3 cats. She has a social cat, B, and a very anxious cat that I know isn‚Äôt using my cat‚Äôs litterbox. Now B he most definitely uses my cat‚Äôs litterbox. He‚Äôs very much a big brother to the 2 other cats and thinks everything in the house belongs to him including my cat‚Äôs food, litterbox, and safe space. So the problem is that sometime after my cat began exploring our apartment, there was a couple of times I found that there was pee on the outside of the litterbox, like they aimed badly. So I got a bigger litterbox because my cat was an 8 month and tiny at first but she‚Äôs clearly getting bigger. So my thought was that she needed more space. And for a while everything was fine, but it happened again this morning, and I hadn‚Äôt seen my cat go in the bathroom where her litterbox is. But I see B pawing litter out on the pee like he was trying to cover it up. Now I am pretty sure it‚Äôs him who has been doing it because the first time it happened I saw him also pawing litter on it. I don‚Äôt have any proof, but I came home to yet again pee on the floor. Ik it says they may have issues if they‚Äôre doing this but part of me really feels like it‚Äôs B trying to use her Litterbox, but because it‚Äôs set up for her (clearly way smaller than him) he‚Äôs trying to use it and missing. Admittedly I had asked my sister to clean it up this morning and she must‚Äôve forgot cos she had just woken up so maybe that‚Äôs why they did it again(?)

For context the reason I say my cat‚Äôs is not as good for him to use is because until I move in a few weeks her litter box only has room to be sat against a wall. She‚Äôs small enough she has room to stand in the litterbox and not  have her face against the wall. Whereas B‚Äôs litterbox has room between it and the wall or any other surface but because he‚Äôs using my cat‚Äôs, he is maybe too close too the wall to aim properly? Not to mention B has been a brat lately with my cat‚Äôs safe space. For example stepping in her water bowl and getting water everywhere, or trying to steal her food constantly, and when she had a bed in there (she doesn‚Äôt use anymore [recent]) laying in it.

I just don‚Äôt see how my little girl could be missing so bad since she is hardly tall enough h to even aim outside of the litterbox. But I‚Äôm concerned now because ik this isn‚Äôt normal.

Please, any advice helps. Ive been trying to read up on things, and the changes I made seemed to help. But now I‚Äôm worried I may need to take my cat to the vet or my sister‚Äôs with hers with it happening more.

Edit: So I‚Äôm not sure if this is gonna work, but I‚Äôm constantly checking the litterbox to make sure no one has an accident, but I‚Äôve moved the litterbox to an area in the bathroom that has more space around it, just in case it really is just a case of one of them not feeling as if they don‚Äôt have enough room to move around when they do their business. Before, 2 sides of the litterbox was against a wall and the sink. But now there‚Äôs space on each side.

Zalixia,Question about pet insurance ,3,2024-05-26 19:12:25+00:00,"I took a cat in at 3 weeks. I know, she should have stayed with mom longer but it wasn‚Äôt an option. She couldn‚Äôt poop so I took her to emergency vet and they gave her fluids, recommended Miralax and it worked. She recently had a fever, took her again to emergency and she was admitted overnight, given antibiotics and was well the next morning. 
I have two other cats on health insurance. I want to put this little one on it too, but I don‚Äôt want the health insurance to consider these things pre-existing conditions. My vet also recently went out of business and I‚Äôm looking to take her to a general care vet to start her vaccines (she‚Äôs only 8 weeks old). When I sign her up for pet health insurance I don‚Äôt want to report these two emergency visits, I want to start fresh with a new vet. Is there a way they can find out? I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble for omitting that, but insurances will use anything to not cover. These were not chronic conditions, just very common things that happen. Is there like a national registry of pet care that can cross check medical records?? Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you.

my cat is going to be staying with us in the bedroom while the other 2 are not allowed inside for about a week

tomorrow im gonna give my cat something that smells like the other 2 and vice versa

however im trying to think of ways to get them to interact thru the door or something since my cat will probably not leave the closet/under the bed for a while. one idea is to carry the other two in the room in a few days and just hold them and show her to them but i wouldnt be shocked to hear this is a dumb idea lol. if anyone has any tips for more ways to get them used to each other please let me know!

Blackcat2332,Need help with a crazy (?) cat,4,2024-05-26 18:16:15+00:00,"  

I want to start off by saying that I‚Äôm not looking for a medical solution as she was already at the vet. I‚Äôve exhausted my financial resources so I‚Äôm unable to take her for many more tests and other vets opinions. I‚Äôm writing this post at the hopes that someone else went through the same thing and can give me a clue what kind of tests I can or should ask the vet to take. 

This will probably be long. 

I got her as a grown kitten off the street. She was about 4 months old. Since the beginning she would growl and hiss at her tail. Two months of her living with me I noticed that her growling became more intense and she would sometimes jump with a hiss as if someone stabbed her at her lower back. I was about to take her to the vet (it was the weekend) but two days later as I got back from work she was in extreme fit. She ran around the room SCREAMING (like cats scream when they fight each other) constantly and attacking her back side. She ran without being able to take a break like trying to run away from a pain. She was not responsive to her environment, meaning no eye contact or acknowledgment if I called her. Which is understandable when someone is in great stress/pain. So I rushed her to the vet and they took x-rays but all showed to be normal. The vet said it might be either neurological or psychological, and prescribed a drug that is a strong pain killer combined with sedative. The drug works, but every time it starts to wear off the growling and hissing return (on herself, she doesn‚Äôt show aggression towards me). 

So for now it seems the diagnosis is that it‚Äôs a neurological issue, and unclear if she‚Äôll be ever able to be off the medicine. I‚Äôm not quiet with this diagnosis as I‚Äôm constantly thinking maybe there‚Äôs some other issue that has a definite cure that the vet missed. Maybe some other tests to find the real reason for her problem the vet didn‚Äôt think of doing. 

More tests in another veterinary clinic or hospital will require a lot of money which I can‚Äôt afford after all the tests and shots she got. But I can afford to ask something specific to be tested the vet she already visited. So I wanted to know if someone here went through something similar and might know of relevant tests that could shed a light on a situation like this.

I cried so much over her, that when i think about her i dont feel sad, i feel happy about how she had a great life and how she passed next to me. My friend had then later on suggested how her cat had kittens and she didnt know what to do with them. We‚Äôve been thinking about it (me and my parents), but i have a small issue. We already have another cat. Hes around 4 years old, but he doesnt act like it. Hes very playful and acts as if hes only a year old. I was doing some research on how many kittens we should get, because as a kitten lady fan, i know that 2 kittens are better than one. But because my other cat is very playful, i dont really know what to do. I asked my dad how he thought my cat would treat a kitten, and he says theyd either be friends or my cat would bully the kitten.. üò≠ So im a bit conflicted on how to treat this. Would 2 kittens be better? How would my other cat deal with 2? Would just one be better, would my other cat act like a kitten to help? i honestly dont really know what to do. ive read up about introducing them, but another fear in my mind is that my cat will run away. My friends cat did this when they got a kitten. I don‚Äôt think my cat would really do that, but i certainly wouldnt put it past him if he was really distressed about the kitten. or maybe im just worrying too much?? i dont even know. help.. üò≠üò≠",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d17g2a/one_or_two_kittens_for_a_4yr_old_cat/

They were likely killed by a random neighborhood tom in the early hours of the day when we were asleep and their mom was away. The mom was grieving the entire day but now seems to be ok, she's back to eating food, however seeing her without her 2 kids, who she never left alone for 3 weeks, is just heartwrenching.

I'm sorry kitties that I couldn't protect you, I hope you're doing ok in heaven üòîüòî

manaswamp40,Advice for New Cat Owner,2,2024-05-26 16:31:00+00:00,"So I adopted a cat that came to my backdoor this past October. He‚Äôs an amazing cat. Very social and we go for hikes with a leash/backpack. However lately he‚Äôs just been meowing almost non-stop during the day to go outside. I have a decent sized patio with lots of plants which has usually kept him happy but its been unbearable lately. I take him for a walk everyday and two long walks everyday during the weekend but in between it doesn‚Äôt change his attitude much. I‚Äôve been looking for another cat to give him company but i‚Äôm a little nervous about it since I‚Äôm a graduate student and don‚Äôt have much money. I‚Äôm also not sure if this would help the problem that much? Since it seems to revolve around him always wanting to be out lately. I tried just letting him be outdoors including outside the patio but my neighbors get mad since he sits outside and taunts their dogs and asked me to keep him in. I‚Äôm considering finding a farmer who wants a cat? Also not sure how to go about that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

northernmaplesyrup1,Potential Constipation Issues,0,2024-05-26 16:05:00+00:00,"Hello I recently adopted two cats we suspect them to be about 7-9 months old. 

I‚Äôve noticed one cats stomach feels a bit hard and bloated and based on the little I do know I suspect it‚Äôs minor constipation. 

In the hopes of getting as good as advice as possible I‚Äôll include everything I currently do know:

A) I don‚Äôt notice them drinking as often nor are they as interested in the wet food that makes up about half of their meals.

B) It seems that days that the bloating feels worse, or their tummy feels more full they have less energy to play and aren‚Äôt as active in chasing the laser pointer or diving for the string.

C) About half the turds I pick up appear to be smaller droplets that in humans I associate with minor dehydration 

D) Their fur feels less soft and their skin seems to be less elastic than that of their brothers 

E) They enjoy having their tummy lightly massaged 

F) They do not appear to be in pain, they enjoy being pet and like to cuddle at night but prefer to sit by the window when bird are out.

As you probably caught on my primary suspicion is that constipation brought on by dehydration. It‚Äôs also possible I‚Äôm noticing symptoms that align with my hypothesis out of bias. (I don‚Äôt have a science background at all üôÉ) 

My current plans are to turn in a stool sample to the vet, try different brands of wet food and get a fountain to make drinking more appealing does anyone think I‚Äôm missing anything or have additional recommendations?

Welchisjelly,4 week old kittens,3,2024-05-26 15:30:14+00:00,"Hello! My cat had a surprise litter of 2 (after only getting her 2 months prior) just about 4 weeks ago today. 

The kittens are out of the nest and now in an enclosure where they have space to crawl/ walk. But that was after we had to look for them and found them under furniture. After putting them in an enclosure and watching most of the day we noticed that mama won‚Äôt let them nurse now, but also refuses to leave their side. She watched the area from the foot of the bed all night. 

After getting 5 hours of sleep she is just staring at them and crying, she has full access to go in and out of the enclosure. 

I am picking up a low entry litter box and formula to mix with wet food in a little bit, to place in a larger play pen to move them too.  

But I can‚Äôt figure out why she is crying. The mom also hasn‚Äôt gone out for the litter box or to play with her sister like she normally does. 

It‚Äôs just been a stressful 24/ hrs. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is this normal weaning behavior or is it because we had to hold them after getting them out from the bed and couch before we could put them back in a safe space?

Vurt__Konnegut,Trying to make a moral decision re: older cat vs saving stray,15,2024-05-26 14:28:04+00:00,"We have an older 14yo cat with diabetes and chronic rhinitis. Not suffering pain, but low activity, always thirsty.  Lost 20% of weight before insulin, but hasn‚Äôt gained any back since.   One vet suggested euthanizing, another vet didn‚Äôt agree.  

We have a wonderful stray show up, friendly, gentle.  I‚Äôve taken it to shelter to check for chip and 10 day lost and found period.   My question is- if no one claims after 10 days, and maybe another two weeks of seeing if someone adopts, would it be right to euthanize the older cat with, at best, two years left, to make space for the stray?  (We can only have two).   Emotionally it seems absolutely not, but from a cold hard logic, it makes sense on one level.

Accomplished_Rock708,My cat loves my boyfriend,0,2024-05-26 14:07:10+00:00,"It‚Äôs really cute honestly. The first time I introduced her to him, it was before we moved in together. I was worried she‚Äôd be terrified of him and not want to be around him but the opposite happened. She fell in love instantly with him and didn‚Äôt want to leave his side. The bad thing for my boyfriend is that he‚Äôs allergic to cats and starts sneezing and itching. He takes allergy medication to help with that and we also now give her a special diet to help lower her dander. We moved in together recently and she‚Äôs all over him now. When he‚Äôs sleeping she‚Äôll sleep on him, no matter what way he sleeps; she‚Äôs on him. She never leaves his side no matter what he does, which has annoyed him on many occasions. She‚Äôll step on his keyboard or stand in front of his computer screen while he works or plays games. 

I thought at first she was only pestering him this way because she wanted to be fed. He was usually the one to get up in the middle of the night to feed her so I thought maybe that‚Äôs why she bothers him as much as she does. But now I realize, she just absolutely loves him. We were gone for two weeks and she treated it like we basically came back from the dead when we came home. Of course she missed me a bit and didn‚Äôt leave me for a whole night but my boyfriend she hasn‚Äôt left him for a second. It‚Äôs so cute watching her express her affection for him. She grooms him and cuddles him while he sleeps, or just sits on his chest and stares at him. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d1255y/my_cat_loves_my_boyfriend/

CatsRCool421,Our cat died and I am Feeling like I failed her,12,2024-05-26 11:41:54+00:00,"Our Lucy girl was 11 years old and she died yesterday.

She was diagnosed  with hyperthyroidism a few years ago. We treated her with methamazole twice daily and she was doing great. We moved her to a new vet at the beginning of the year after we had moved. They found she was anemic but wanted to keep an eye on it. Her thyroid and kidney levels often had a push-pull. When one level was great, the other level wasn‚Äôt doing too well. We took her in for blood work last month and her hemoglobin was down significantly. We did an infectious disease label to see if that was causing the anemia, but everything came back fine. We chose to start her on medication and a diet change, which she was doing well on until three days ago. I couldn‚Äôt bring her in sooner because my partner was away and I was solo parenting at the time with my toddler. She started hiding in deep, dark places of our house. She looked like a shell of herself, often coming down to drink water and meow. We finally decided to take her to an emergency vet. She had to be stabilized the minute she got there. She had a low heart rate, low blood pressure, low temperature, etc. she was in shock when I brought her in. The vet said her kidney values were so bad, they couldn‚Äôt get a reading. She required ICU level care but that nothing was irreversible. We‚Äôd be buying time to see what was causing her kidney failure, not fixing it. I feel guilt because the price tag was $5-7K for ICU time and if she was going to guaranteed get better with that time, we would have spent that money but the vet said letting her go was compassionate.

So I sat with her while she passed, very peacefully. I told her how much I loved her and how she was amazing and how she drove me crazy when she got underfoot. 

This is hard. This is the first animal that was under my direct care, that was my baby. I‚Äôm going to miss her and can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I failed her. I hope whenever she is now, she is happy. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d0zir5/our_cat_died_and_i_am_feeling_like_i_failed_her/

trainercatlady,My cat is a good Protector. AKA: Cat Social Structures are Fascinating.,0,2024-05-26 08:17:51+00:00,"My roommates and I have been slowly vacating our home for the last month and a half, and just today, one roommate moved her cats to her new place, after they and my cat have been co-habitating for the last 4 years. My cat (Ianto) has gotten very close to one of my roommate's cats (Pascha) to the point where we've called them boyfriends. She also has an older lady cat (Amara) who is very sweet and I will miss her dearly.

So, as my roommate was packing some stuff up to leave, and obviously her cats too, she put Amara in a kennel for transport while she looked for Pascha. Pascha is VERY skittery and shy and while they were moving stuff, decided to hide somewhere. I was getting messages (I was at work) asking about places he could hide. I figured it had to be in my room somewhere since that was the place with the most nooks and crannies that wasn't being actively shuffled around that he could access.

While my roommate was packing and looking for Pascha, Ianto decided to come into her area and meow (probably hungry. idk, I was at work), and to dismiss him, my roommate said, ""Go find your boyfriend"". Apparently, he did, because he left immediately and ran upstairs.

She eventually made her way to my room, and Ianto was reportedly standing guard in the doorway, and I was told that he got Real Mad when she tried to enter, and she had to get one of our other roommates to corral him. In the meantime, while she was searching my room for him, Amara was in her kennel and crying, and Ianto went over to watch her, sitting in front of her kennel the entire time while they fished Pascha out of my room (He was in my closet), after which Ianto went and babysat him.

Other Roommate told me that he sat at the window and watched the other two get carried away and driven off, and after that, he just laid on the floor. 

When I came home from work, Ianto heard me and meowed very loudly (something he hardly ever does when I come home). My poor boy. I think he's lonely already.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d0wrli/my_cat_is_a_good_protector_aka_cat_social/

NervGS,Cat pee smell in the toilet - tips on getting rid of odor in my place,0,2024-05-26 06:27:14+00:00,"Hi all,

So I got my 7 year old cat about 5 weeks ago now, and two weeks into having him at my place, I randomly caught him peeing in my toilet - previous owners did not teach him how to do this nor have ever seen him exhibit this kind of behavior before, and I had zero interest in teaching him how...  When I caught him I thought I was seeing things and I was very much convinced it was a one time thing - it was NOT, as I caught him doing it again like two days later, but I actually got a picture to make sure I wasn't losing it: https://i.imgur.com/CE2ehUw.jpg

He's been using the toilet to pee now pretty much all the time as I rarely scoop up any clumps from his litter box, though still uses it to poop thankfully.  It's to the point now where I am completely used to it and it's just what he does - I just have to keep the seat DOWN all of the time just as a precaution so he doesn't fall in (first time it was up and he had no problems - but I am not going to chance that)  

Everyone I've told this to tells me how lucky I am, and how smart he must be as he just taught himself with zero instruction and interest from me, and how much I am saving on kitty litter, but they don't have to actually live with him....  

This is an issue when you arrive home from being at work for the day, and the first thing you notice is the pee odor that is ultra strong and coming out from the bathroom......  The stuff has been sitting in the toilet for 7+ hours!

Does anyone have a cat that does this?  I haven't tried something like poo pourri yet as I'm a bit scared of what his reaction could be like with that smell since cats can be a bit crazy about other odors.  Like it would be awesome if there was something I could use to just eliminate the odor instead of masking it with something else.  

At my old place years ago I remember the toilet there would almost do a light/soft flush every hour or two when the water in the tank went low - I'm not sure if that was a feature of the toilet to keep water in the bowl running & fresh or if it was a very small leak, but I do remember seeing the water very, very, very lightly running in the bowl all of the time.

I'm NOT about to teach him how to flush because I can see that going out of control.

Any tips to eliminate this odor is appreciated.  Thanks!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d0v9bv/cat_pee_smell_in_the_toilet_tips_on_getting_rid/
Ancient-Shadows,Cat has a neck wound and won't stop scratching it open,4,2024-05-26 06:20:01+00:00,"We're officially almost out of ideas folks. Our cat was recently neutered and the vet made the gauze that kept the cone in place way too tight. Why my parents didn't check it coming home? No idea, but now it's done and she's got her whole neck raw. Initially it healed really well, but she keeps scratching a spot on the back of her neck open. 
We've tried special cream to help healing and prevent scratching, when that didn't help she got shots at the vet so it wouldn't itch. Did nothing. A bandage won't stay on her neck and prevents healing somewhat anyway.
Only thing we haven't tried yet are socks, but I'm just not confident they will stay on.
It's been almost 3 weeks and the wound keeps looking worse.
We have shorn the surrounding fur already.

Is there anything you can think of?
As I said a bandage, body or cone won't work, because of the position of her wound.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d0v5mv/cat_has_a_neck_wound_and_wont_stop_scratching_it/
PsychoPassProstitute,Update on an update.,0,2024-05-26 06:13:46+00:00,"Posted here about my kitty Ursula and her health problems. Well, it‚Äôs got worse.
I posted about her poor xray, her shallow breathing, loss of appetite.
Yesterday she got her fluids and we were quickly done. However, she became kind of apathetic, barely moved or reacted. It took her a long time to be a bit more herself.
We thought it could have been because of a stingy injection she had to get as she was abused in the past.
Today though things got more complicated. Doctor found blood in her rectum when he took her temperature. She also seems to be loosing fluids despite getting the infusions and getting water.
The doctor said she looks poisoned but she is a home kitty. And we are particular about the plants we keep since they chew on some. Basically we are trying to keep a fully safe environment for them. We keep safe plants, don‚Äôt use anything chemically that could hurt them in any way.
We really feel so lost. He took another blood sample to send it and the blood was dark.


Edit: xray looks clearer, more normal. She also got some corticosteroids and something to calm her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d0v2j0/update_on_an_update/

WTF - are these dudes just out of control reckless? 

One's at large.
One found the front of a vehicle.
I reckon the latest chap fell poorly out of a tree, all his knee ligaments are blown in the right rear leg.

He will NOT get through the recuperation period for the liganent surgery so is amputation /  prosthetic limb the next best option. 

Is there a prosthetic that will work for an active outdoor cat? Gary is relentless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1d0uw99/young_male_cats/
